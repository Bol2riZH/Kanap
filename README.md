## OpenClassrooms Project 5 - Kanap e-commerce (JS)

Here we come to the main/real/best part of developpement : **programming**

### With JavaScript you make your website come to life, you make it dynamic and users will be able to interact with it.

Before I going to this project, I learn JS by myself for about 160h. My mindset was to get all the basic as clear as possible.


I think the mission was complete as I finish the project in 1 week or so.

I did a [plan test](https://github.com/Bol2riZH/Kanap/files/10155915/Reungoat_Matthieu_2_plan_test_082022.pdf) to check if of the functions was working as expected.
